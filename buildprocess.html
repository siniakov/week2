<h2> The Camper Build Process</h2>
<h3>Acquisition</h3>
<p>When we first got the camper, it had been sitting in the old owner’s field for nearly 30 years, and mice had nested and damaged a big portion of the inside. Everything but the shell – all flooring (and subflooring), cabinets, furniture, appliances – was removed, leaving us with a shell on top of a single-axle trailer platform. Before we got our mitts on the camper, we had help putting down a new layer of subflooring and insulation on the underside of the camper.</p>
<h3>Cleanup</h3>
<p>After the subfloor installation, we had to clean the camper and prep the inner walls for habitation. </p>
<p>Note: Apparently in ’66, it was fairly common to coat the walls in Zolatone, a very durable and scratch-resistant material….also used in truck bed liner. Getting the Zolatone off took 1.5-2 months of heavy manual labor out of the total 3.5 month build.</p>
<p> We started by coating the subfloor with some latex paint and covering it in dropcloths to protect it from the results of inner wall cleaning later on. After protecting the floor, it was time to scrub and really start renovating in earnest:
<ol>
	<li>Scrape loose/peeling Zolatone by hand</li>
	<li>Use a pressure washer to get three decades of grime off</li>
	<li>Attempt to use Citristrip (comparatively less-toxic paint stripper) to soften the Zolatone. Note that the Zolatone won’t simply dissolve like regular paint; it’ll only soften. That means scraping the softened Zolatone off manually off every square inch of the camper, floor to ceiling.</li>
	<li>Realize that Citristrip isn’t strong enough, switch to more-toxic (and more-effective!) Aircraft Paint Remover.</li>
	<li>Scrape softened Zolatone off aluminum walls.</li>
	<li>Realize getting Zolatone off the fiberglass bulkheads is near-impossible without the paint remover doing strange things to the fiberglass.</li>
	<li>Leave fiberglass alone.</li>
	<li>Pressure wash fiberglass.</li>
	<li>Paint bulkheads with low-VOC latex paint.</li>
	<li>Cleaning and prep work done after 5-6 weeks of 8-hour alternating shifts 3-4 days/week! Rejoice. Everything’s much easier from here.</li>
</ol>
<p> Note 1: We started doing paint removal in mid-May when it was still fairly cool outside (~50-60 degrees). The warmer the temperature in which the stripper is applied, the faster and easier it is to scrape the Zolatone off. Once we hit 80-90 degrees outside, we barely even had to apply pressure – the gel ate through the Zolatone pretty easily. Unfortunately, that also meant it ate through our protective gear more quickly. We went through 3-4 sets of jumpsuits over the course of the project. </p>
<p> Note 2: We worked with a lot of protective gear, including fullbody jumpsuits, sturdy rubber boots, heavy-duty gloves, eye goggles, and properly-classed respirators. The respirators are particularly important – if they fail, bad things happen.</p>

<h3>Structure</h3>
<p>After the walls and bulkhead were prepped, we began installing flooring on top of the subflooring (watertight vinyl click-plank boards, made to look like dark wood. Very durable, but prone to scratching if you drag something like casters or a chair over it).</p>
<p>We also made wheelbase covers to make the rounded compartments where the wheels sat into flat-topped space. Once we had flat usable surfaces to work with, we started building out the structure and defining the camper space:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Building the platform and base for the bed. The bed is elevated to allow rollout underbed storage; the base that the foam mattress sits on is made of wide slats to allow for more airflow (to prevent nasty things like mattress mold).</li>
	<li>Threading, spray-painting and assembling black pipe for the countertop supports. Den really wanted butcher block (hello, Menard’s trip!), and the pipes would be plenty sturdy to support it. </li>
	<li>Erecting the box/frame the shower would sit in. </li>
	<li>Building the platform the toilet would sit on. (Due to some existing quirks with the way the original blackwater tank, we needed the toilet raised. For comfort reasons, we also made an executive decision to have a standard porcelain flush-style toilet rather than a RV toilet.)</li>
	<li>Installing the toilet, shower stall, and shower hardware.</li>
</ol>

<h3>The “Guts”</h3>
<p>After the framing/construction for the various “rooms” of the camper, we started working on the things that would make the camper actually operational – electrical, water, waste, and heat. In practice, that meant:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Making sure the blackwater tank was structurally intact (this was an extremely unpleasant task, as the prior owners had not cleaned it out before sitting it in a field….The waste was solid and needed to be broken down with a combination of enzymes and mechanical force.)</li>
	<li>Making sure we had the appropriate fittings to make the connection between the tank and the sewage drain that would be at the campsite (these conversion fittings were hard to find).</li>
	<li>Testing the existing wiring in the camper, mapping out the circuits, tearing out damaged wiring, and replacing it with new.</li>
	<li>Running PEX tubing for water to the toilet/bidet, shower, and sink, and planning ahead for hot/cold water connections.</li>
	<li>Installing the water heater (originally we went for a 4-gal water heater, then upgraded to a 19 gallon due to quality of life issues).</li>
	<li>We originally planned to use electric heat, but after several months of actually living with electric heat, we found our electricity bills astronomically high. We tried out propane, had some troubles with it, went to wood heat (which helps with humidity issues but meant wild temperature fluctuations and freezing mornings) and electric blankets, and ended up supplementing that with kerosene heat.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Making it Livable</h3>
<p>Once the major systems were in place, we started building out the components that made it more usable:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Installing storage (medicine cabinet, shelving, wardrobe)</li>
	<li>Installing butcher-block countertop and dropping in a sink</li>
	<li>Converting a narrow apartment natural gas stove to propane and dropping it in</li>
	<li>Multiple IKEA trips to get storage solutions (dry goods bins, pull-out shelves, etc.) </li>
	<li>Installing a hanging rack for use with IKEA hanging S-hooks for kitchen supply storage </li>
	<li>Installing a backsplash near the stove to prevent oil/grime from building up on the painted plywood</li>
	<li>Adding in an AC unit/heat pump</li>
	<li>Appliances (minifridge – later upgraded to a full-sized kitchen fridge due to quality of life issues, microwave, coffeemaker – later taken out due to disuse, desktop dishwasher added with custom housing after 1 year of living in the space) </li>
	<li>Cutting the foam mattress to size with a bread knife, hauling it into the camper (this was much harder than it seemed with the tight angles and relatively small size of the camper door. It involved a lot of banged heads and swearing.)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Moving in; Moving Onto Location</h3>
<p>Because we were using a single-axle build, there are a few key things that made moving the camper to the desired campsite difficult – and most of these things had to do with weight. With all the stuff we crammed into the camper, we were nearing the camper’s haul capacity, so we actually had to transport the camper with the really heavy appliances taken out. Those were put back in once we got the camper to the site, put it on blocks, balanced it, and hooked up our connections.</p>
<p>One of the key things we struggled with was “clutter management.” In a small space, especially one under 150 sqft, it’s very easy to overwhelm if things aren’t always 100% neat and tidy. It took a few tries to get this right.</p>

Citristrip didn't work well at removing the Zolatone when we spot-tested it, so we had to move up a level to something more caustic, but also more hazardous. Safety first!</figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="assets/images/applyingstripper.jpg" alt="individual in protective gear applies paint stripper to camper wall with a roller brush"/><figcaption>We applied the paint stripper with roller brushes in 2- or 3- square foot areas, let it sit for 15-20 minutes while we went out to get air, then scraped it off with scrapers. The mateial was so sturdy it didn't dissolve, but came off in soft paper-mache-like strips.</figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="assets/images/damagedgloves.jpg" alt="a protective glove with one finger missing, damaged by harsh chemicals"/><figcaption>The paint stripper was extremely caustic - when air temperatures spiked to 90 F, it definitely sped up the paint removal process...But also started eating away at our protective gear more quickly! We went through a lot of gloves and coveralls. </figcaption></figure>

The shower pan sits in the bottom. We had to cut the walls to size because the curved ceiling made everything uneven.</figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="assets/images/toiletplatform.jpg" alt="man assembles plywood platform."/><figcaption>Because of how the existing blackwater tank fitting was placed, we needed to have the toilet raised up a bit on a platform.
