    <h1>Burden and the Bebop: Tiny Camper Life!</h1>

<div id = "content">
	<h1>Welcome to the Bebop!</h1>
	<p> This blog details how Burr and Den (Burden) renovated their 1966 Avion aluminum camper for living in the US Midwest. Please feel free to poke around! </p>
	<h2>Why's it Called the Bebop?</h2>
	<p>We lovingly call the camper the Bebop because it's a rusty bucket o' bolts, just like the ship in the 90's anime <i>Cowboy Bebop.</i> When we started renovating it, there were a lot of holes in the hull, and we had to do a lot of jury-rigging to leak-proof it. We like to think it's got some character.</p>
	<h2>Why a Camper Renovation?</h2>
	<p>The camper was inexpensive to live in and fulfilled Burden's needs - a place to eat, sleep, shower, and store things. Spartan living was OK.</p>
    <h2>How Much Did Camper Renovation Cost?</h2>
    <p>The project was built top-down (excluding cost of camper shell acquisition â€“ a few packs of beer!) for about $7,000. Other considerations taken into account (but not factored into initial build costs include iterative changes, cost of hauling/transport (pickup truck - already had), and monthly rent/water/electricity/sewage fees at the campsite they reside at ($525 for two people, $475 in the off season).</p>
    <h2>Do You Still Live in the Camper?</h2>
    <p>The Bebop was our living space for 1.5 years; after a particularly harsh Midwestern winter (temperatures as low as -30 degrees Farenheit with wind chill), we decided it would be more effective to move into an apartment at approximately the same pricepoint (thermal mass!). We learned a lot from camper life, including our respective needs vs. wants in a living space -  lessons that we'll draw on when we build our next living space. For now, the Bebop's taking a well-deserved rest!</p>
