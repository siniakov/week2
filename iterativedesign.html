<h2> Iterative Design and Overcoming Challenges </h2>
<p> The biggest challenge Burden faced was the cold Midwestern US weather – temperatures dip well below zero, and old campers have significant insulation and heat retention issues. This meant getting creative, and sometimes just abandoning things that didn’t work. </p>
<p> Things we ended up changing as we lived in the space:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Changing rollaway underbed storage. Our original low-lying design was space-saving, but structurally weak. We ended up changing the low-lying design for a more straightforward pine-crate-on-wheels.</li>
    <li>Heating. This went through several iterations: electric (only somewhat effective, astronomically high bills) to propane (leak/safety issues) to wood heat (cheap/free due to existing wood sources, but wildly fluctuating temperatures and much more effort required) to wood heat with a kerosene backup.</li>
    <li>Increased storage space. Originally we had a layout with a small lounge chair for reading, which we switched out for a hanging clothing rack, and then eventually into a full-sized closet/cabinet.</li>
    <li>Switched out appliances. Minifridge &rarr; full-sized fridge. Coffeemaker gone, dishwasher added.</li>
    <li>Hot water capacity: 4 gal &rarr; 19 gal hot water heater. 2-minute army showers are not fun. 19 gallons means a 15-minute shower!</li>
</ul>
<p>There were also a number of issues we had to troubleshoot:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Blackwater tank clogs. As the remaining waste needed to be flushed out while we were using the camper, there were some moment where the tank outlet clogged and needed to be manually unplugged. This was a very unpleasant process. We also started using a bidet to reduce the volume of paper mass going into the tank. (Bonus, bidets are more sanitary!)</li>
	<li>Freezing water lines and drains. We had a few points where the water lines would regularly freeze over the course of the winter including at the regulator (outside the camper) and at various points inside the camper where the water lines (PEX tubing) tracked closely to the outer wall. We remedied this with a combination of heat-insulation foam tubing (inside the camper) and electric heat wrap for exposed intake hoses (outside the camper.) For the drains, we used deicer salt, but it wasn't necessarily effective. In the coldest months, we just showered at the gym.</li>
